# JU React Complete Resources #

## What's this repository for? ##

This repository provides access to all my "React" code snapshots. When working with React, these can be used as a "React Refresher" or just to learn React.

Thank you so much [@maxedapps](https://twitter.com/maxedapps) for all the knowledge you bring to this field.

## Repository Content ##

Code Snapshots: All code snapshots can be found in the Code folder.

## For Developers - How To Use Code Snapshots ##

You are free to play with the code snapshots and develop further. Attribution is not mandatory but appreciated :)

Try running these code snapshots on your machine or importing them to codesanbox.io. 

* Summary of set up
If you want to run these on your local machine:
	- Clone this repository 
        - Open your favorite git terminal "ex: visual studio code, git bash, etc" in the individual snapshot folders
	- Run `npm install` in the individual snapshot folders. It will install all packages that are present on the folder's `package.json`.
        - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

* Dependencies
	- `package.json` in the individual snapshot has all dependencies and also has information about `engines`, meaning which `node` and `npm` version these run on.

* How to run tests
	- You can run several commands inside the individual snapshot folders:

		- `$ npm start` - Starts the build for development.

		- `$ npm run build` - Builds the code for production.

		- `$ npm run format` - Formats files.

		- `$ npm run lint:css` - Lints CSS files.

		- `$ npm run lint:js` - Lints JavaScript files.
