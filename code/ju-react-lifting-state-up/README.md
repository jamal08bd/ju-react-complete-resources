## React: State ##

Background: In React, if we have a state that is manipulated in component A but required in component B, we should lift the state up to a component that has access to both components (A & B) that need the state.

Solution: This code snapshot is an example of how we can lift the State up.

To run this example:

- `npm install` or `yarn`
- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
